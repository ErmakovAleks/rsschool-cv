My goal is to become an Android developer. I like the fact that you can do a lot of interesting things with a device that fits in your pocket and I would really like to be able to expand the functionality of this device and create things that will allow people to do some things more conveniently, faster, easier. For the time being, a lack of knowledge prevents me from doing this, which I am going to fill in the very near future.

My current profession is design engineer. I would like to use my knowledge to create a unique product that will be useful to other people.

At the moment, I have a good command of 3D modeling, I have experience in the development of industrial electrical equipment. Learning the basics of Java Core and OOP. I am currently taking the Stanford CS-103 course in computer science.
In the learning process, I carry out educational projects: programs that implement image encoding and decoding, archiver, calculator and other projects.

**Education:**
Kryvyi Rih Metallurgical Faculty of the National Metallurgical Academy of Ukraine: Specialist Diploma in Electrical Engineering

*English:* Pre-Intermediate. I am currently improving my English
